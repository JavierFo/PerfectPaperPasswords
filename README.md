## Implementation 

**The current repository includes a visual password implementation for an iOS 13 app built with Swift 5.** 

## Instalacion 

1. Clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JavierFo/PerfectPaperPasswords.git
2. In the local repository, open PerfectPaperPasswords.xcodeproj using Xcode 11.
3. Within Xcode 11, press the 'Build' button located in the upper left corner.
4. Run the application using the Xcode simulator or an iOS 13 or higher device.
5. Within the application, modify the parameters with which the letters will be generated, which are:

- Key. Pressing the 'Make New Key' button generates a new 256-bit key.
- Alphabet. You can use the suggested alphabet or change it to a custom one, which will characterize the passwords.
- Number of characters. Number of letters that each password will be composed of.

6. Press the 'Generate Cards' button to create cards with passwords. Pressing the 'Save' button will save the passwords with the 256-bit key that generated them.
7. When you run the application again, press the 'Save Cards' button to retrieve the previously saved card.
